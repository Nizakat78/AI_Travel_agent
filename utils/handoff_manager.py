class HandoffManager:

    Conceptual class to manage the handoff logic between agents.
    In an actual OpenAI Agent SDK implementation, this might be handled internally
    by the SDK's runner or by defining specific "tools" for handoff.
    This file is primarily a placeholder to maintain the suggested structure.
    The handoff logic is more directly implemented in main.py and agent's process_query returns.
